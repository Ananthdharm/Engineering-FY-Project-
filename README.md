### Abstract
58% of Indiaâ€™s population relies on agriculture to earn their living. In view of this, farmers contribute
most to the Indian economy among many other professions. While technology evolves, the agricultural
sector still follows ad-hoc procedures and is yet to be digitised. Starting from sowing seeds,
maintenance of the crops and timely watering of the crops are some of the essential tasks among many
others. This paves way for technology to help and support farmers to perform their tasks smartly and
help them focus on tasks that require human intervention.
Technologies like IoT, AI/ML, and Server-End technologies can essentially help in creating a pipeline
of streamlined processes that are reliable and convenient to farmers. These technologies help build an
ecosystem of smart processes which ultimately makes farming an easier occupation and less prone to
risks.

We have built an android application and a front end application that enables farmers and other users to
go through the different stats of the sensors on the field. The android application enables the farmers to
remotely monitor the statuses of different factors such as the amount of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and
Potassium in the soil, the humidity in the air, moisture in the soil among other factors. The app is also
capable of performing disease detection for tomato and potato plants. The front end application that we
have built represents real time values for the temperature and also predicts the prices of tomatoes and
potatoes based on the values present on the dataset.
